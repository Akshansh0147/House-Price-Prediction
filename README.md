We are going to work on a dataset which consists information about the location of the house , price and other aspects such as square feet etc. When we work on these sort of data , we need to see which column is important for us and which is not. Our main aim today is to make a model which can give us a good prediction on the price of the house based on other variables. We are going to use Linear Regression for this dataset and see if it gives us a good accuracy or not.
